Since my Apple Watch arrived in late April, I've worn it. But I soon found that I was looking for something different with my fitness tracking.

- I wanted step tracking

- I like the Fitbit software better

- The heartrate tracking is better

- The Apple Watch notifications are nicer, but add a lot of noise for little benefit

- The Apple Watch looks nicer than the Fitbit, but both still look like "tech gadgety" things, even with nicer bands. So any ranking in this category is still like saying that a hammer to the toe is better than a sledgehammer to the face.

- The Apple Watch communications features are weird, and not very useful

- The Apple Watch is what spawned my newest interest in fitness
