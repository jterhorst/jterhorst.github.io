In my efforts to teach some folks I know what I know about Core Data, I set up some example code and a video explaining it.

The video is here on Vimeo: [https://vimeo.com/81466705](https://vimeo.com/81466705)
The example code is on Github: [https://github.com/jterhorst/LargeCoreDataExample](https://github.com/jterhorst/LargeCoreDataExample)
